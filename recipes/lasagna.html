<h3>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.</h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 carrot</li>
    <li>1kg Beef Mince</li>
    <li>400g Crushed Tomato</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
    <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go</li>
    <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
